                    A Play! application follows the MVC architectural pattern as applied to the 
                    architecture of the Web.
                    
                    This pattern splits the application into separate layers: the Presentation 
                    layer and the Model layer. The Presentation layer is further split into a 
                    View and a Controller layer.
